# Sequential Monte Carlo Figures

We include several figures to help visualize the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm.

The first, Figure 1, was made by-hand and as such we do not include
code to produce it, however, it is available in the repository and data release.
The code for producing the other figures is described in each of these notebooks:

- [Annealing the posterior distribution](./plotting/temperature_plot.ipynb)
- [Evolution of the inverse temperature](./plotting/plot_beta.ipynb)

Running these notebooks requires you to have configured an appropriate environment.
See [the instructions here for details](./environment).
