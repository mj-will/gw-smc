# Analyses with simulated data

In the paper, we use a series of simulated analyses to validate Sequential
Monte Carlo. These are divided into:

- [Binary black hole analyses](bbh_analyses.md)
- [Binary neutron star analyses](bns_analyses.md)

and are described in Section 5. The above links include details on how to reproduce
the figures in Section 5 using the data provided in the data release, or optionally
run the analyses.
